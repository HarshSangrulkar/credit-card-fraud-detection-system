# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Overview:
This project is designed to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to build a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions within credit card transactions datasets.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional for data exploration)

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project should contain credit card transactions, labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. Ensure proper preprocessing and exploration to handle imbalanced classes.

Model Selection:
Various machine learning models can be employed for credit card fraud detection. Commonly used models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. Experimentation may be needed to determine the most effective model for your dataset.

Usage:
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and imbalance in the dataset.
Explore and understand the distribution of features.
Model Training:

Train the selected machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset.
Consider techniques such as cross-validation for model evaluation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
